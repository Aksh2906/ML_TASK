CASTLED! Varun Chakaravarthy keeps picking up wickets in this World Cup. He fires this one full and on middle, turns in as this is the googly. Max O'Dowd makes room and has a big hoick across the line but plays all over it. The ball goes through and uproots the leg stump out of the ground. Netherlands are 35/1, chasing 194 runs.","Over_No":"6","Batsman_Name":"Max O'Dowd","Milestone":[],"Non_Striker_Name":"Michael Levitt","Bowler_Conceded_Runs":"0","OID":20039.0,"Howout":"b Varun Chakaravarthy","This_Over":"1,1,0,0(W),","UID":20039,"Score":"35/1","Bowler_Details":{"Bowler":"67469","Overs":"0.4","Maidens":"0","Runs":"2","Wickets":"1"},"Fielders":[],"inning":"2","Id":"39","Non_Striker_Short_Name":"M Levitt","_id":{"timestamp":1771437084,"date":"2026-02-18T17:51:24.000+00:00"},"Detail":"W","Ball_Speed_This_Over":"\"94.4\",\"94.1\",\"93.0\",\"93.9\"","Non_Striker":"107562","Timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:27:39+05:30","Runs":"0","Batsman_Short_Name":"M O'Dowd","Over":"5.4","Default_Commentary":"5.4: Varun Chakaravarthy to Max O'Dowd, OUT! b Varun Chakaravarthy.","Ball_Speed":"93.9kph","Ball_Line_Length":"21,3,10,20,35,15","Bowler":"67469","Ball_Number":"34","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"65585","Runs":"20","Balls":"18","Fours":"2","Sixes":"1"},"Isball":true,"Shot_type":"Beaten","matchId":"268102","Edited_Commentary":1,"Bowler_Name":"Varun Chakaravarthy","Bowler_Short_Name":"V Chakaravarthy","type_id":0,"Batsman_Runs":"0","Batsman_Style":"R","Created_Timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:26:56+05:30","Dismissed":"65585","ZAD":"","Non_Striker_Details":{"Batsman":"107562","Runs":"13","Balls":"16","Fours":"2","Sixes":"0"}},{"Ball":"3","Non_Striker":"107562","commentaryTimestamp":1771450027000,"Batsman":"65585","Shot_type_id":"3","language":"eng","Timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:27:07+05:30","Runs":"0","Batsman_Short_Name":"M O'Dowd","Over":"5.3","Default_Commentary":"5.3: Varun Chakaravarthy to Max O'Dowd, No run.","Ball_Speed":"93.0kph","Ball_Line_Length":"28,5,9,8,43,18","Bowler":"67469","Ball_Number":"33","Batsman_Details":{"Batsman":"65585","Runs":"20","Balls":"17","Fours":"2","Sixes":"1"},"Isball":true,"Shot_type":"Flick","matchId":"268102","Commentary":"Pushed through quicker, short and on middle and leg, angling in.
